Create simple parsers in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) projects at compile-time. Warning: Hacky and experimental. 

Example taken (modified) from [advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/), day 8:

```Zig
test "AoC day8 (modified)" {
    const alloc = std.testing.allocator;
    const Opcode = enum {
        nop,
        acc,
        jmp,
    };
    const Instruction = struct {
        opcode: Opcode,
        operand: ?i32,
    };
    // Parser definition:
    // within a struct, opcodes and operands are space-separated:
    const PInstruction = Join(Instruction, " ");
    // parse unknown number of space-separated instructions, separated by \n:
    const PInstructions = Join([]PInstruction, "\n");
    // name the data structure without formatting
    const Instructions = Unformat(PInstructions);
    expect(Instructions == []Instruction);
    const parser = ParserStr(PInstructions);

    const raw_instructions =
        \\jmp +109
        \\acc +10
        \\jmp +18
        \\nop
    ;
    const parsed = try parser(alloc, raw_instructions);
    defer alloc.free(parsed);
    expect(parsed.len == 4);
    expect(parsed[2].opcode == .jmp and parsed[2].operand.? == 18);
    expect(parsed[3].opcode == .nop and parsed[3].operand == null);
}
```

# Details

To be more precise, here is the correspondence between Zig types and regex/formal grammar rules:

- Optional `?T`: regex `T?`
- Slice `[]T`: regex `T*`
- Array `[19]T`: regex `T{19}`
- Enum `enum { a, b, c }`: regex `(a|b|c)`
- Struct `const X = struct { a: T, b: U }`: formal grammar rule `X → TU` (**but** does not handle recursive languages, i.e. setting the type `U` to `*X` for instance)
- Tagged union `const X = union(enum) { a: U, b: V }`: formal grammar rule `X → U | V` (non-recursive either)

The parser is a very naive [recursive descent parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) with caveats:

- does not deal with runtime errors gracefully
- does not deal with compile time errors of types. For instance, `Join(u32, " ")` should fail but doesn't. That's because either we write `struct { a: try Join(u32, " "), ...` and it segfaults, or we have to declare all intermediary types used nested.

Right now, the way it is implemented is that `Join([]u32, sep)` creates a new type `struct { child: []u32, const tokenizer = std.mem.tokenize(val, sep); }`. Not great. We could avoid deeper nestings if we could reify types with declarations as [proposed here (#6709)](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/6709).

We could have more cool stuff, like:

- Proper error handling, not sure how yet
- Comptime verbose mode
- A new type transformer `Ignore(T)`, corresponding to data that we don't want to capture. For example, if a struct has a first field `a: Ignore(u32)`, it means we need to parse it but do not store it.
- A new type transformer `Wrap(T, '{', '}')`.
- Serialization? Should be quite straightforward.
